<h1>Why my Nom de Guerre is Latte, Jed?</h1>
<p class="date">Friday, Jul 22, 2016</p>

<p>I've been asked a few times why I go by "Latte, Jed?" online. I know I'm dating myself here but I grew up on the cartoonist Gary Larson's <em>The Far Side</em>. If you haven't already, avail yourself of his work. He's undoubtedly the king of surrealist cartoons -- lighthearted but intelligent.</p>
<p>The panel in question is this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/latte_jed.jpg" alt="Latte, Jed?" /></p>
<p>Keep in mind that at the time he drew this coffee culture in America was nothing like it is today. A <em>caff√® latte</em> was a relatively exotic thing, so having a cowboy produce an espresso machine was particularly funny.</p>
