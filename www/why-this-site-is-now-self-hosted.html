<h1>Why this Site is now Self Hosted</h1>
<p class="date">Tuesday, Jul 19, 2016</p>

<p><strong>Note: While this site is still self-hosted, it's now managed by Hugo so most of what's below doesn't apply</strong></p>
<p>This site, now in its <del>current brutalist form</del>, has been hosted in a few different places over the years. I don't write that often but I've made some effort to maintain a site since I got into software. That's usually meant picking a decent blog hosting platform and writing something about 1/10th of the times I've thought I should. I've used Tubmlr, Posterous, Posthaven (the post sale reboot of Posterous), GitHub and was considering Medium and then said fuck it, I'll just put it on a server somewhere and be done with it.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplicity. A static website is an exceedingly simple thing. I'd rather just write one in vim than deal with a webpage-as-text-editor.</li>
<li>Style. <del>While this site may be (intentionally) ugly</del>, it was exaclty what I wanted and didn't require dealing with a theme interface nor did someone else decide what my site should look like for aesthetic or technlogical reasons.</li>
<li>Dumbed down services. Hosting a site for any length of time almost invariably requires redirects or file hosting or a form or whatever. Existing services don't provide some or all of these.</li>
<li>Performance. It's really hard to beat a VPS from a decent provider (I use Digital Ocean) with CloudFlare's free plan as a CDN. If my site is simple I expect it to load in a microsecond. Most servies aren't that great.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was actually hosting this most recent version on GitHub. GitHub's offering has a lot of nerd appeal. You can edit locally, deploy with a <code>git push</code>, they've got a CDN (as far as I know) and it's free or included in whatever plan you've already got with them.</p>
<p>Then I spent 45 minutes trying to figure out how people set up 301s when using gh-pages and was disappointed to find out they don't. Some people recommend using refresh and canonical meta tags on a basic page (supposedly SEO acceptible). There's even a Jekyll plugin for it. To me that just sounds silly.</p>
<p>Also, Jekyll. Whenever you push to GitHub it treats your site as a Jekyll site and tries to "compile" it. Even if it's not a Jekyll site. It fails sometime without reason and "fixing" it usually means pushing empty commits until it works.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point wasn't to complain about hosting a site on GitHub, but rather the fact that these services will likely end up costing you more time than they're worth. Setting up nginx or apache to host a static site isn't very complicated and it's a much better skill to learn than the quirks of some service.</p>
