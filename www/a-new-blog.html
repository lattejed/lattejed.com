<h1>A New Blog??</h1>
<p class="date">Monday, Dec 31, 2018</p>

<p>If you follow this blog, which analytics tells me you don't, you'll notice it keeps changing hosting tech, posts get dropped and other chaos. That's because I've both neglected this blog <em>and</em> keep telling myself to write more.</p>
<p>But because I'm an obsessive software engineer, I have to start with setting the blog up in a way that makes me happy.</p>
<p>After a few different tries (posthaven, ghost, hugo) I wrote a simple generator in node.js and am currently hosting on a Dokku setup.</p>
<p>For the time being I'm happy with this. Who knows when I'll change it again. Excelsior!</p>
