<h1>I Just Doubled My Tezos Holdings</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday, Dec 15, 2018</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/tezos.jpeg" alt="Tezos" /></p>
<p>I just doubled my <a href="https://tezos.com/">Tezos</a> holdings.</p>
<p>Back <a href="/i-just-invested-in-tezos.html">here</a> I talked about why I invested in Tezos. I also made the prediction that the market would crash (two or three times) before Tezos took off. It looks like we're in downturn number one.</p>
<p>Tezos is currently <em>below</em> ICO price in the mid $0.30s. While people keep telling me that crypto is now a terrible investment, I'm pretty sure investing 101: Buy Low, Sell High, still holds.</p>
<p>It amazes me how many people forget the basics and invest based on emotion. Markets don't die, they just slow down for a while. Buy on the dips.</p>
